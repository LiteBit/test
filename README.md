# Hello

We will build a community driven resource.

* Bigger proposals have to be an own document which will be placed into "code" as an own *.md document
* It would make sense to have a predifined directory structure to address proposals into the right "category"
* Minor suggestions are just Issues which will end up in an own document, once they are figured out for implementation
* task management is done within projects. Bigger Proposals can have own projects
* dicussions over proposals will be made within issues
* in issues we can tag, address and manage the issues
